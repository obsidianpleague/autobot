LAN CONTROL - MASTER SERVER GUIDE
===================================

This guide explains how to set up your "Master Laptop" (Server) to control all 600 client computers.

1. THE CONCEPT
--------------
- **Server (You)**: Runs the `System-Controller.ps1` script.
- **Clients (Them)**: Must have the `DeployAdmin` user account created (by running `ENABLE-LAN-DEPLOY.bat`).
- **Connection**: PowerShell Remoting (WinRM) over the network.

2. SETTING UP THE SERVER
------------------------
You do NOT need to install the Autobot software on the server. You only need the `LAN-Control` folder.

    Step 1: Prepare the Folder
        - Copy the `LAN-Control` folder from the USB to your Desktop.
        - Open the folder. You should see `System-Controller.ps1`, `TargetList.txt`, etc.

    Step 2: Populate the Target List
        You need to tell the server which IP addresses to control.
        
        OPTION A: Automatic Generation (Recommended)
        - Right-click `Generate-IPs.ps1` -> Run with PowerShell.
        - This will overwrite `TargetList.txt` with a full range of IPs (e.g., 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.1.50).
        
        OPTION B: Manual Entry
        - Open `TargetList.txt`.
        - Type the IP addresses of the client computers, one per line.
        - Example:
            192.168.0.1
            192.168.0.2

3. PREPARING THE CLIENTS
------------------------
For the server to control a client, the client MUST have the `DeployAdmin` user.
    
    * IMPORTANT: Ensure `ENABLE-LAN-DEPLOY.bat` was run on every client computer.
    * If you forgot to run it during installation, you must go back and run it manually on each machine.

4. RUNNING VIA GUI (Simpler)
----------------------------
    Step 1: Right-click `System-Controller.ps1` -> Run with PowerShell.
    Step 2: Enter Credentials (User: DeployAdmin / Pass: Jamb123!)
    Step 3: Choose Action (1=Launch, 2=Shutdown).

5. RUNNING VIA COMMAND LINE (Advanced)
--------------------------------------
If "Run with PowerShell" is blocked or you prefer the terminal:

    Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator.
    Step 2: Navigate to the folder:
        cd "C:\Users\YOUR_USER\Desktop\LAN-Control"
    
    Step 3: Run the Controller:
        powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\System-Controller.ps1

    Step 4: Run Target Generator (Optional):
        powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Generate-IPs.ps1

6. TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------
- **"WinRM cannot process the request"**: The client didn't run `ENABLE-LAN-DEPLOY.bat`.
- **"Host Unreachable"**: The computer is off or the IP is wrong.
- **"Access Denied"**: Wrong password relative to what's on the client.
